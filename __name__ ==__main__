when python runs a file, before running the code
it sets a special variable __name__ == __main__

default __name__ == __main__

but incase if v import file1 in to another file2
and tries to run method/code of the file1 from the file2
here __name__ is set to file1 instead of __main__



note: __name__ == __main__ whenever python runs a source file directly,
	whenever the file is imported it sets to imported file's name

Example 
-------

mod1.py
-----------
def sample():
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        return True
    return __name__


mod2.py
-------------
import mod1

print(mod1.sample())
# gets the module name that is imported, since that module is executed from this python file - not directly by the python.

print(__name__)
# gives the __main__ as result since this file is executed by the python directly
